<p lead>There’s been a lot of talk lately about the <a
        href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md">PSR HTTP message
    proposal</a>, PSR-7. The purpose of the proposal is to create a shared interface that can be used by projects to
    interact with HTTP messages for both clients and servers.</p>

<p>When <ins>I created the proposal, I envisioned the purpose is not to say projects</ins> that utilize HTTP messages need to make
    breaking changes to use the proposed interfaces, but rather give projects an interface for which they can create an
    adapter. For example, if there are swaths of changes to the proposal before it is accepted, then it is very unlikely
    for <a href="http://guzzlephp.org">Guzzle</a> (a very popular PHP HTTP client that I created) to utilize the
    interfaces directly. I also very much doubt that projects like Symfony or Zend Framework would update their HTTP
    message interfaces to match (at least in the near future).</p>

<h2>H2 Message Bodies</h2>

<p>The biggest point of <mark>contention with the proposal so far has been deciding on how the body of an HTTP</mark> message will be
    represented. In the current proposal, the body of an HTTP message is exposed using a StreamInterface that provides
    the following methods:</p>

<p aside>When I created the proposal, I envisioned the purpose is not to say projects that utilize HTTP messages need to make
    breaking changes to use the proposed interfaces, but rather give projects an interface for which they can create an

    interfaces directly. I also very much doubt that projects like Symfony or Zend Framework would update their HTTP
    message interfaces to match (at least in the near future).</p>

<p>There are several other options that could have been utilized to represent an HTTP message:</p>

<ul>
    <li>string</li>
    <li>iterators</li>
    <li>PHP streams</li>
</ul>

<p>Ordered</p>

<ol>
    <li>string</li>
    <li>iterators</li>
    <li>PHP streams</li>
</ol>

<h3>H3 Message Bodies</h3>

<p>Utilizing a string would have required that the entire contents of the message be loaded into memory. This won’t work
    when you’re interacting with web services like Amazon S3 where it is common to download objects storing gigabytes of
    data.</p>

<p>Utilizing iterators <em>could</em> work, but it would likely cause a significant performance penalty due to the fact
    that each call to <code>next()</code> would return only a single byte, resulting in a huge number of method calls to
    download large files. Furthermore, it would provide a read-only representation of a message body.</p>

    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/guzzle/streams/blob/master/src/LimitStream.php">Limit the data to be read to a
        subset of a large stream</a>. This requires <code>getSize()</code>, <code>tell()</code>, and various other
        methods to be decorated to limit the wrapped stream to only a subset of the larger stream.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/guzzle/streams/blob/master/src/NoSeekStream.php">Prevent seeking of a stream</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/guzzle/message-integrity-subscriber/blob/master/src/ReadIntegrityStream.php">Implement
        message integrity checks</a>. This will throw an exception if a calculated rolling checksum of stream data as it
        is read does not match the expected checksum.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/guzzle/progress-subscriber/blob/master/src/UploadProgressStream.php">Provide
        progress information</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If the StreamInterface were able to return an underlying resources that can be mutated, then you would be breaking
    the abstraction by abandoning any decorators and you would be leaving the StreamInterface in an inconsistent state.
    Because of this, the only way that the StreamInterface should return an actual underlying PHP stream resource should
    be when the <code>detach()</code> method is called (a method that already promises to leave a StreamInterface in an
    inconsistent state). Calling <code>StreamInterface::detach()</code> would return <code>null</code> if the
    StreamInterface doesn’t actually wrap an underlying resource, or would return a PHP stream resource if one is
    utilized.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I recently pushed a change to Guzzle’s streams API that implements this change: <a
        href="https://github.com/guzzle/streams/commit/368ee042ef5d88ffbc19632e0c114a54a3ac45b2.">https://github.com/guzzle/streams/commit/368ee042ef5d88ffbc19632e0c114a54a3ac45b2.</a>
    While detaching the underlying resource will not utilize any decorators that have been attached to the
    StreamInterface, it will provide a native PHP stream resource that does not need to utilize a custom Guzzle stream
    wrapper.</p>


<p>I think that a similar change to the StreamInterface proposed in in PSR-7 should be made.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I’ve outlined the different approaches that can be taken to represent HTTP message bodies in PSR-7 and provided more
    motiviation as to why I proposed the StreamInterface solution. Using PHP streams directly does not allow for a
    robust stream decoration strategy due to the fact that PHP streams suffers from legacy PHP warnings and errors. By
    showing how you can use a custom stream wrapper to convert a StreamInterface to a PHP stream and by returning the
    underlying PHP stream resource when the <code>StreamInterface::detach()</code> method is called, I’ve addressed the
    concern that you cannot utilize native PHP streams when using a StreamInterface abstraction.</p>
